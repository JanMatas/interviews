# Frontend interview questions

### Problem

Let's build a "public transport usage viewer" as a webapp. Imagine you are commuting daily from place A to place B and you want to check in advance what is the best time for you to set out so you won't be crammed in a tight bus or metro space. 

**Example**
>I live in Holesovice and every morning I go from Vltavska tube station to Vysehrad. I should be able to open the app and see at what times is the rush hour and when is the best time for me to get to Vltavska to have a nice journey.

**Questions**
1. You you have the perfect backend which has all the information about the public transport prediction. However, you somehow need to expose it (via an API, WebSockets, databse or something). How would you do that, why?
2. Stack/tech for building frontend. Also probe deeper into how they set up repo - CI and so on.
3. How would you "design" the layout of the website, what high-level components will you need?
4. You will presumably need to display a map for this app, how would you go about that? How woudl you go about pathfinding?
5. Do they use React, why yes, why not? Do they use functional components? How would you test these components?
6. Do they use Redux, why yes, why not? How do they design the redux state? Is it flat?
7. Do they use Typescript, why, why not? How would they set it up? What would be some example interfaces here?
