# Deepnote coding interviews

### Purpose of coding interview:
- See if they can code. This doesn't mean just solving the question, but also style, attention to details, coding practices, how independent they are while solving a problem.
- Provides a springboard for further topics: testing, CI, language features, their specific skillsets..
- The question itself should be quite easy to figure out even under interview conditions


## Q1 - Circular queue
- Write a class implementing a circular queue. Should have a maxSize, enqueue() dequeue() isFull() isEmpty() methods
- Candidate should be able to argue why it's better than normal queue (no wasted space right)
- Edge cases: full/empty case, circular indices (ideally with modulo, but if/else is fine as well)
- Error handling - not important for implementation but nice if they can talk about it
- They should write tests for all of these
- Do this on a computer and in English
